    # TODO:
    # Write the code necessary to calculate a cost map for the given map.
    # To calculate cost, consider as example the following map:    
    # [[ 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    #  [ 0 X 0 0 0 0]
    #  [ 0 X X 0 0 0]
    #  [ 0 X X 0 0 0]
    #  [ 0 X 0 0 0 0]
    #  [ 0 0 0 X 0 0]]
    # Where occupied cells 'X' have a value of 100 and free cells have a value of 0.
    # Cost is an integer indicating how near cells and obstacles are:
    # [[ 3 3 3 2 2 1]
    #  [ 3 X 3 3 2 1]
    #  [ 3 X X 3 2 1]
    #  [ 3 X X 3 2 2]
    #  [ 3 X 3 3 3 2]
    #  [ 3 3 3 X 3 2]]
    # Cost_radius indicate the number of cells around obstacles with costs greater than zero.
